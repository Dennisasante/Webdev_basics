    <h2>How to prepare jollof rice</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large yellow onions, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil(80 mL), plus 2 tablespoons, divided</li>
      <li>14 oz diced tomato(395 g), 2 cans</li>
      <li>6 oz tomato paste(170 g), 1 can</li>
      <li>1 habanero pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon mixed dried herbs</li>
      <li>3 chicken bouillon cubes, crushed</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups long grain rice(500 g), rinsed</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen mixed vegetable(150 g)</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water(360 mL)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth.
        Transfer to a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the
        blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot
        over medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water
        has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder,
        ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes,
        stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep
        red in color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce
        the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for
        another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is
        absorbed.
