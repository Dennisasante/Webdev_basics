    <h1>Waakye</h1>

    <p>
      Waakye, a dish made from beans and rice, is a familiar sight to most
      Ghanaians. This simple, nutritious meal can be found on sale all over the
      country, from restaurants to street food stalls. But how did it actually
      come to be? Who makes the best jollof rice: Ghanaians or Nigerians? This
      simple question forms the basis of the Jollof Wars, in which citizens of
      these nations take to social media to debate whose rendition of this
      originally Senegalese dish tastes best. Although there’s no actual fight,
      the banter and jokes can get intense, with national pride at stake.
